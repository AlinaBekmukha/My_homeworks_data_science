# Project 0. Guess a number

## Task   
We need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Conditions:**  
- The computer creates an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess" we mean "write a program that guesses a number".
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.

**Quality metrics**     
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions
