# The project task:
"Imagine that you got a job in a recruitment agency that selects vacancies for IT specialists. Your first project is to create machine learning (ML) models that will offer jobs for candidates applying for the Data Scientist positions. You need to understand where the data comes from and how it leads to the outcome of the project. This part of the ML project is called Data Understanding or Data Analysis."
