# Task Description

## Problem: Can we predict the real hotel reviews for Booking.com?

Letâ€™s say that we work as a data scientist at Booking.com. One of the problems of the company is the dishonest hotels that twist their ratings. One way to detect such hotels is to build a model that predicts the rating of the hotel. If the predictions of the model differ greatly from the actual result, then perhaps the hotel is being dishonest and it is worth cheching it out. Let's look at the data that we have and work through it.

First we will import all the relevant dependencies we need.
